  About Health by Jasmin
  Hi! I’m Jasmin – the person behind Health by Jasmin, a small one-woman business based in Stockholm, Sweden. I’ve been practicing Ashtanga yoga and Ayurveda for nearly 15 years. What first pulled me in was the structure, the rhythm, and the way both practices bring things into focus – sometimes gently, sometimes boldly.</p>

 <p class="about-text"> I fell in love with their holistic approach and how they challenge you to look at yourself and your habits from a completely different angle. In 2015/2016, I started Health by Jasmin to create a space where I could share what has deeply resonated with me over the years.</p>
  
  <p class="about-text">I do this in small doses – through yoga classes, short courses, the occasional retreat, and of course, the magical Ayurvedic massages. I also offer talks and introductions to Ayurveda, to help people get a better understanding of its beautiful foundation.</p>
