        <h3>Ashtanga Yoga</h3>
        <p>Ashtanga Yoga is a practice where the breath is at the core, synchronized with gentle, dynamic movements.
          By following a set sequence of postures, an inner rhythm is cultivated that promotes balance, presence, and transformation.
          The practice is an inward journey that strengthens both body and mind, with a focus on calmness and gradual progress at your own pace.</p>

        <h3>Ayurveda</h3>
        <p>Ayurveda offers us the knowledge and tools to strengthen and heal ourselves, both physically and mentally.</p>
          The word Ayurveda comes from Sanskrit and means “the knowledge of life.” Originating in India, it is one of the world’s oldest systems of health.</p> 
          One of the most well-known aspects of Ayurveda is the dosha theory, which describes each individual’s unique personality and body type.</p>
