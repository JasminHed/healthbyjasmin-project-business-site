    <h1>Yoga</h1>
    <p>
      Yoga is more than movement — it is the practice of awareness and connection between body, mind, and spirit.
      Here you can explore classes to support your daily life and practice. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ashtanga Yoga</h3>
    <p class="ashtanga-text">
      

      Ashtanga Yoga is a practice where the breath is at the core, synchronized with gentle, dynamic movements. The method comes from India and, just like Ayurveda, it looks at the whole person — body, mind, and everything in between. </p>
      
      <p class="ashtanga-text"> We start where we are, and work with what we’ve got. Everyone can practice Ashtanga — just in different ways. For those who feel called, there’s a traditional six-day-a-week rhythm. But for most of us, it’s about practicing when we can and in a way that fits our lives.</p>
      
      <p class="ashtanga-text"> Ashtanga has two main styles: one is called Mysore, a self-practice where you slowly learn a set sequence of poses, bit by bit, with help from a teacher. The other is the more familiar guided class, where everyone moves together with instructions. Both are valuable. </p>

      <h3>Yin Yoga</h3>
  <p>
    Yin Yoga is a slow, meditative practice focused on stillness and deep release. 
    Poses are held for several minutes to target the connective tissues — fascia, ligaments and joints — 
    rather than the muscles. This allows for improved flexibility, joint mobility, and a calming effect on the nervous system.
    Yin invites you to turn inward.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Vinyasa Yoga</h3>
  <p>
    Vinyasa Yoga is a dynamic and fluid style where movement follows the rhythm of the breath. 
    Each sequence flows seamlessly from one pose to the next, building strength, balance and focus. 
    Vinyasa can be energizing and grounding, offering space to both challenge and reconnect with yourself.
