    <h2>Packages</h2>
    <div class="packages-grid">
  
      <!-- PACKAGE 1 -->
<div class="package">
  <h3>Small Business Website (Custom Built)</h3>
  <p>
    A custom-built website with up to 4 pages, designed as you envision it. No e-commerce.
  </p>

  <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
  <p>
    We build your website from scratch based on your requirements. If you have a graphic profile, a specific design, or a vision — we make it that way. You don't need to understand the technology; that's our job.
  </p>

  <h4>Why do I have to pay monthly for maintenance?</h4>
  <p>
    A custom-built website needs regular updates to stay secure and function properly. Think of it like a car—you need service checks to keep it running smoothly. We handle security backups, system updates, fix any issues and we're there if something goes wrong. You can focus on your business instead.
  </p>

  <h4>Who is this for?</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>You:</strong> Don't know much about websites, or you want it exactly your way. Maybe you have a graphic profile from your designer. You want a professional, unique site that doesn't look like everyone else's. You appreciate having someone take care of the overall website.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Development time:</strong> 2.5 weeks
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>One-time development fee:</strong> 6,500 SEK
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Monthly fee:</strong> 1,200 SEK/month of maintenance and updates
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Maintenance includes:</strong> Content and image updates, bug fixes, security backups, security patches, and email support (48-hour response). Larger changes are quoted separately.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">
    <em>You cover: domain, hosting. You can provide content and images before or after the project starts.</em>
  </p>
</div>

<!-- PACKAGE 2A -->
<div class="package">
  <h3>Package 2A — Build & Handover WordPress</h3>
  <p>
    A website with up to 4 pages built with WordPress (a simple content management system). E-commerce is possible.
  </p>

  <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
  <p>
    We build your site with WordPress, which is a system where you can update text and images yourself without needing to code. It's like a word processor for websites. You log in and change what you want.
  </p>

  <h4>Who is this for?</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>You:</strong> Know a bit about websites, or are willing to learn. You're not afraid to click around in an admin panel. You want more control than a completely pre-made solution, but don't need everything custom-built.
  </p>

  <p>
    WordPress is also good if you think your website will grow —y ou can add new features and tools yourself later (with the help of searchable guides online).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Development time:</strong> 2 weeks
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>One-time development fee:</strong> 4,000 SEK (includes 1 training session)
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">
    <em>You cover WordPress subscription and domain. You provide content and images before the project starts. You handle all updates and maintenance yourself afterward. </em>
  </p>
</div>

<!-- PACKAGE 2B -->
<div class="package">
  <h3>Package 2B — Build & Handover Squarespace</h3>
  <p>
    A website with up to 5 pages built with Squarespace (a simple, all-in-one system). E-commerce is possible.
  </p>

  <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
  <p>
    Squarespace is a complete, easy solution. You don't need to understand website  stuff — just focus on updating your content or leave it as is. It looks professional right out of the box.
  </p>

  <h4>Who is this for?</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>You:</strong> Don't know much about websites and don't want to learn. You want something simple and professional that "just works." You want to update your content or products but nothing more complicated. You don't want to worry about stuff, just want to focus on your business.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the easiest, least stressful option if you want a professional website without any headaches.
  </p>

  <p>
