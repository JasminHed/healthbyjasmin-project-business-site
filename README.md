Live Demo: https://healthbyjasmin.netlify.app/

Overview
This is my very first web development project - a complete business website that I built from the ground up. I learned so much creating this site, from basic HTML and CSS to making it work perfectly on phones and computers. It was challenging but rewarding to see my code turn into a real, working website that people can actually use.
