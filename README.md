# JS Project: Business Site
**Live Demo:** [https://healthbyjasmin.netlify.app/](https://healthbyjasmin.netlify.app/)  

This is my very first web development project â€” a complete business website that I built from the ground up. I learned so much creating this site, from basic HTML and CSS to making it work perfectly on phones and computers. It was challenging but rewarding to see my code turn into a real, working website that people can actually use.

## The Problem
I wanted to create a functional, responsive business website to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The challenge was to combine layout techniques, interactive features, and deployment skills while ensuring the site works smoothly on all devices.
